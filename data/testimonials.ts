    text: "This was a last-minute booking during the night. And it exceeded our expectations! We were upgraded to the deluxe by our very friendly reception staff, who made us feel very welcome. The deluxe room was really good! The shower was incredible, the bed super comfy and it was clean with air-con and a big TV. Bearing in mind it's still a motel (with free parking in mind) it was perfect, with no disturbances. It's not a 5-star hotel, but I give it 5 stars for a great motel.",

    text: "My friend and I were traveling from Victoria and came across some trouble early hours of the morning needing somewhere to stay. We called the motor inn and headed on down. We were greeted by the friendliest person I've ever met who treated us so kindly and nicely especially not really knowing what we were doing. We got put into a really nice room and had an extremely good night's sleep. I highly recommend this place to anyone who needs somewhere to stay in Sydney! 10/10 service, thank you so much! We'll be back 🙂",

    text: "A comfortable and affordable overnight stay after a long-haul flight. Loved having access to 24hr check-in and secure parking. The room we stayed in had been recently refurbished and was fresh, clean, with a really comfortable bed. Staff was very friendly and welcoming, thanks. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for somewhere affordable to stay close to the city and public transport.",
